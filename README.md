# Jurie "JustAGhosT" Smit

Staff / Principal Engineer – AI Platforms, Governance & DevEx

I design and build AI + cloud platforms for regulated, high‑stakes environments  
(fintech, national citizen portals, multi‑tenant SaaS), where compliance, uptime and cost really matter.

---

## What I actually do

- Turn legacy, fragile systems into **governed, observable service architectures**
- Build **agentic / LLM platforms** with real policy seams, auditability and cost controls
- Automate **delivery workflows** (PR review, infra promotion, change risk) without killing developer flow

---

## Flagship projects (code > claims)

- **cognitive-mesh** – Agent / LLM runtime with RBAC, audit trail and policy evaluation for Azure OpenAI + RAG.  
  _Demonstrates: AI platform & governance architecture._  

- **CognitiveMeshUI** – Next.js / TypeScript UI and design system for agents, audit views and telemetry; Storybook‑driven.  
  _Demonstrates: front‑end architecture and UX telemetry for complex platforms._  

- **autopr-engine** – AI‑assisted PR reviewer that runs in CI, Docker or locally, with Jira / Linear / Slack / Teams integration.  
  _Demonstrates: CI/CD ecosystems, AI‑in‑the‑loop workflows, provider‑agnostic design._  

- **vv-iac** – Azure landing‑zone IaC (Bicep/Terraform) with what‑if validation, budget guardrails and gated promotion across envs.  
  _Demonstrates: infra‑as‑code, policy‑as‑code, cost and change‑risk governance._  

- **home-lab-setup** – Reproducible Azure homelab (P2S VPN, DNS, cert lifecycle, monitoring, cost reporting), published as a PowerShell module.  
  _Demonstrates: practical automation, security‑minded infra, operational discipline._  

- **crisis-unleashed-app** – Full‑stack FastAPI + React reference app (auth, clean architecture, CI/CD, tests).  
  _Demonstrates: modern full‑stack execution pattern I use for teaching / prototypes._

## Impact highlights (outside GitHub)

- Led customer‑facing architecture & delivery for **South African eHomeAffairs** and **eVisa** portals under heavy operational constraints.
- Modernised legacy citizen and financial platforms by decomposing monoliths and introducing contract‑first, modular services.
- Introduced AI tooling and IaC guardrails to reduce review toil, enable safer changes and keep infra cost under control.

---

## Current focus

- Lower‑latency, more explainable policy evaluation for agentic systems  
- Deterministic, forward‑compatible audit event schemas  
- Reducing false positives in AI‑assisted PR review via semantic diff weighting  
- Making infra promotion safer (pre‑merge what‑if + policy checks as a single gate)

---

## Architecture & stack

AI / agent runtime → Governance → Automation → Delivery → Observability on top of Azure:

- Azure · Bicep · Terraform · .NET
- Python / FastAPI · TypeScript / Next.js
- REST / gRPC · Event‑driven patterns
- Policy‑as‑Code · OpenTelemetry · GitHub Actions · Hexagonal / selective DDD
